# Circom Examples 

This is a repository with simple Circom examples.

## Preliminaries

### Install node
First off, make sure you have a recent version of `Node.js` installed. While any version after `v12` should work fine, we recommend you install `v16` or later.

If youâ€™re not sure which version of Node you have installed, you can run:

```sh
node -v
```

To download the latest version of Node, see [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Install snarkjs

To install `snarkjs` run:

```sh
npm install -g snarkjs@latest
```

If you're seeing an error, try prefixing both commands with `sudo` and running them again.
