/*
*** AliasCheck(): template that receives an input in representing a value in binary using maxbits() + 1 bits and checks that the value belongs to the prime field (that is, if in represents the value x in binary, then the template checks that x <= p-1)
        - Inputs: in[maxbits() + 1] -> array of maxbits() bits
                                   requires tag binary
        - Outputs: None
         
    Example: in case we are working in the prime field with p = 11, then AliasCheck()([1, 0, 0, 1]) is satisfiable as 9 < 11, but AliasCheck()([1, 0, 1, 1]) is not as 13 >= 11. In the second case the executable program (C or WASM) reaches a false assert, and the generated R1CS is not satisfiable
